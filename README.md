## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Learned how to share state between child, parents and sibling. Moved the state and its function to set the state to the parents, so the state in the parent become the only source of truth.

```js
const Parent = () => {
    const [timeCategory, setTimeCategory] = useState("daily");
    const handleTimeCategoryChange = (timeCategory) => {
        setTimeCategory(timeCategory);
    };

    return (
        <Child1 timeCategory={timeCategory} onTimeCategoryChange={handleTimeCategoryChange} />
        <Child2 timeCategory={timeCategory} />
    )
}

const Child1 = ({ timeCategory, onTimeCategoryChange }) => {
    const handleChange = (timeCategory) => {
        onTimeCategoryChange(timeCategory);
  };
}

const Child2 = ({ data, timeCategory }) => {}
```

- Learned how to map a component, so we can only work on one componenet and then map each of the needed component and pass props to change the component state or style

```js
Const Parent = () => {
    return (
        <>
        {data.map((data) => (
            <Child data={data} />
        ))}
        </>
    )
}

const Child = ({ data }) => {}
```

- Learned how to add another instance of object in one object notation

```js
const thisOneObject = data.timeframes[thisAnotherObject].current
```

### Continued development

Can try to develop another same function application and maybe use a backend and a database and add a authentication of users.
